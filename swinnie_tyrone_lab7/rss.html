		<h2>Google Nexus</h2>
		<article> Google hasnâ€™t released any devices with its stamp of approval after it acquired Motorola. Google has followed Microsoft in promoting its Android platform as an independent OS. It has tried to remain impartial by having its Nexus devices developed by different companies that have licensed its product, and LG having the honors for this version of the device. To the dismay of many customers, the first Nexus 4 devices were sold out within no time in Google's Play Store. 

		<p> The second wave that was available from December 6th was again out of stock just before Christmas. Seen objectively, this is no surprise. The combination of the low price and state-of-the-art hardware is not the only selling point. Its innards are comprised of a quad-core Krait clocked at 1500 MHz and 2 GB of RAM alongside the Adreno 320 GPU. The buyer can select between a storage capacity of 8 or 16 GB. There are no color options; it is only available in black. Google's new super weapon was a hot topic and was eagerly awaited even before it was launched. Read in our review whether it can meet the high expectations and how we rate it against the competition. </p></article>

		<h2>Apple Iphone 5</h2>
		<article>The excitement of the rumor mill, the titillation of every leaked photo led to higher than ever levels of expectation for the iPhone 5, and while the announcement was greeted with some derision at the lack of perceived headline improvements, the record sales tell an entirely different story.
Given the underwhelming changes to the iPhone 4S, the iPhone 5 really needs to re-energize customers to prove Apple can repeat the game-changing trick it managed with the iPhone 4.
So is the Apple iPhone 5 the greatest smartphone ever, one that will finally see Apple ascend to the top spot in our 20 best mobile phones chart? Or is it a case of too little, too late?

		<h2>Blackberryz10</h2>
		<article>
			<p>The BlackBerry Z10 is the first handset from the company formerly known as RIM, now renamed BlackBerry, to run its new operating system BlackBerry 10, and there's much more on the line here than simply making a few pennies - arguably the company's survival rests on the success of this device and the BlackBerry Q10.
It's no secret that BlackBerry has been on the rocks for the past year or so, with the company even admitting that it hasn't been in the best shape of late, and the 4G toting Z10 is the start of what is hoped to be a successful revolution.
Since its launch a few months ago the BlackBerry Z10 has received a software update which has seen things become more stable, plus the app store has also witnessed some new arrivals, so we've taken the time to update the keys parts of our review with the latest information. </p>
